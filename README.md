## ℹ️ About

Webscreen is a self-hosted screen streaming web application for Android and Linux devices, based on WebRTC. Might support more devices in the future!
![screenshot](doc/assets/screenshot.png)

It can run on:

- Android Termux
- Linux
- Windows
- MacOS

on both `amd64` and `arm64`

Android supports ([scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)):

- Video, Audio, Control
- UHID Devices (Mouse, Keyboard, Gamepad)
- Clipboard Sync
- Touch (Multi-finger, pressure)
- H.264/H.265
- Multi-Connection
- Maybe more...

Linux supports (Xvfb/Xorg/Sway):
- Video, Control
- Touch
- H.264/H.265
- GPU (Xorg/Sway)

## Prerequisites

For device side, please refer to [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/README.md#prerequisites)

For server side, you'd better have `adb` and `xvfb, ffmpeg, xfce4, sway, wf-recorder (if need this feature, optional)` in your PATH first.

```bash
# Build by yourself:
git clone https://github.com/huonwe/webscreen.git
cd webscreen
make

# Use pre-built binary:
apt install adb
# if you want to stream Linux display
apt install xvfb ffmpeg xfce4 sway wf-recorder
# then you can directly use pre-built binary
```

**for client side, you need a web browser that support WebRTC (H.264 High Profile, or H.265 Main Profile).**

## Usage

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/huonwe/webscreen/releases), execute the program. The default port is `8079`, but you can specifiy it by `-port 8080`. 6-digit PIN is also needed (default to no password). An example command: `./webscreen -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080 -pin 555555`
Then open your favorite browser and visit `<your ip>:<your port>`

Or you can build by yourself. Normally, you can build simply by `go build`. But if you want to build by yourself on `Termux`, you need to run `go build -ldflags "-checklinkname=0"`.

You can also use docker.

For lite version:

```yaml
services:
  webscreen:
    image: dukihiroi/webscreen:latest
    container_name: webscreen
    network_mode: host
    # If you want to use bridge network:
    # You need to ensure that your device is accessible from the container
    # You also need to forward the necessary UDP traffic. If you face problems on it, please use host network mode.
    # ports:
    #   - "8079:8079"
    #   - "51200-51299:51200-51299/udp"
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
    privileged: true
    environment:
      - GIN_MODE=release
      - PORT=8081
      - PIN=123456
```

For full version which including Linux desktop environment:
`cp .env.sample .env`

```yaml
services:
  webscreen-full:
    user: appuser
    image: dukihiroi/webscreen-full:latest
    container_name: webscreen-full
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
      - /dev/input:/dev/input
      - /run/udev:/run/udev:ro
    devices:
      - /dev/uinput:/dev/uinput
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
    group_add:
      - ${UINPUT_GID}
    privileged: true
    environment:
      - GIN_MODE=release
      - PORT=8081
      - PIN=123456
```

`host` network mode is recommended because of UDP traffic and device connection.

You might need to pair Android device in [wireless debug](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) first. `Pair device with pairing code` is supported. Once you finished pairing, type `Connect` button and enter necessary information.

After you start streaming, you might need to manually make the scene a little changed, to get the screen. You can simply click volume button to make it.

## FAQ

- Crash: MediaCodec 0x80001001 Exception on custom Android devices due to hardcoded H.264 High Profile (profile=8) [#11](https://github.com/huonwe/webscreen/issues/11)
  - set **profile=1** to **video_codec_options**

## Android APK (rooted device, no adb, no Termux)

This fork can also be built as an Android APK that runs webscreen **on the phone
itself**, so a rooted device can stream its own screen to a browser without adb,
Termux or any PC side helper:

```
rooted Android phone → install WebScreen.apk → grant root → Start
                     → webscreen listens on 0.0.0.0:8079
PC browser → http://<phone-ip>:8079
```

How it works: with `-local-root`, webscreen stores the embedded scrcpy-server in
`/data/local/tmp/webscreen/`, starts it locally with
`app_process64 ... tunnel_forward=true send_dummy_byte=false`, and connects to the
`scrcpy_<scid>` abstract socket itself. WebRTC, audio, input, clipboard, PIN auth
and the web UI are untouched.

Build it in the cloud: **Actions → Build APK → Run workflow**, then download
`WebScreen-debug.apk` from the run's artifacts. See
[doc/android-apk.md](doc/android-apk.md) for the full instructions, requirements
(root, arm64, Android 8+) and known limitations.
